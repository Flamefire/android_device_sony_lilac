        Removed all custom CarrierConfigs to provide a single, universally functional one. We cannot
        be expected to make CarrierConfigs for all providers in the world, but we do want our phone
        to work with as many of them as possible. So, we keep Custom Modems and enable required provisioning,
        since, for carriers that need this functionality, Android will go through provisioning, while,
        for carriers that do not need / offer this functionality, they will register a compatible
        phone inside IMS regardless, providing us with the possibility of setting the provisioning
        complete this way.
